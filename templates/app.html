        <p>How do different news agencies cover topics? Does CNN cover immigration differently than Fox? Does Breitbart discuss Trump differently than the New York Times?</p>

        <p>Using the method described in <a href="">Machine Learning Techniques for Detecting Identifying Linguistic Patterns in the News Media</a> by <a href="https://gleap.org">A Samuel Pottinger</a>, a model that can predict which news agency wrote which article can also find "exemplar" articles, allowing one to glimpse across the news media landscape by searching for articles that are "prototypical" of their publishing agency. If you type "climate", for example, this machine learning application will find the most CNN-like article about climate change posted by CNN. Try Russia, Immigration, Brexit.</p>
