        This section does not replace the full text of the privacy policy below and may not summarize the rest of this page. We do not use cookies. Certain web server logs are collected on a temporary rolling basis to ensure prevention of abuse and proper website function. Those logs include IP addresses. Permanent logs for research purposes are also collected with page title, timestamp, query, and user agent (browser, OS, etc). Those permanent logs include IP address hashes with a salt as to de-identify visitors and may be used in future public research. Those hashes could be cryptographically broken such that the original IP addresses could be found but doing so is difficult and Data Driven Empathy LLC will not engage in attempting to recover those original IP addresses unless compelled by law. Users may request data removal using the contact info below. Users will need to provide agent string and IP address.
